We present a theory for the evolution of molecule masses and show that small molecules grow by random diffusion and large molecules by a preferential attachment process leading eventually to life's molecules. It reproduces correctly the distribution of molecules found via mass spectroscopy for the Murchison meteorite and estimates the start of chemical evolution back to 12.8 billion years following the birth of stars and supernovae. From the Frontier mass between the random and preferential attachment dynamics the birth time of molecule families can be estimated. Amino acids emerge about 165 million years after the start of evolution. Using the scaling of reaction rates with the distance of the molecules in space we recover correctly the few days emergence time of amino acids in the Miller-Urey experiment. The distribution of interstellar and extragalactic molecules are both consistent with the evolutionary mass distribution, and their age is estimated to 108 and 65 million years after the start of evolution. From the model, we can determine the number of different molecule compositions at the time of the creation of Earth to be 1.6 million and the number of molecule compositions in interstellar space to a mere 719."

Accumulated oligosaccharides were isolated and analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and methylation analysis. Man alpha 1----3Man beta 1----4GlcNAc and Man alpha 1----2Man alpha 1----3-Man beta 1----4GlcNAc (where Man is D-mannose and GlcNAc is N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) comprised greater than 80% of the total oligosaccharides in untreated mannosidosis cells. However, Man alpha 1----6[Man alpha 1----3]Man beta 1----4GlcNAc was the major Man3GlcNAc isomer present after 7 days of swainsonine treatment. No mannose-containing oligosaccharides were detected in control fibroblasts in the absence of swainsonine but, in its presence, oligosaccharides containing 2-9 mannose residues accumulated. Man alpha 1----6[Man alpha 1----3]-Man alpha 1----6[Man alpha 1----3]Man beta 1----4GlcNAc and Man alpha 1----6-[Man alpha 1----3]Man beta 1----4GlcNAc were the major components (67%). Surprisingly, Man alpha 1----3Man beta 1----4GlcNAc was only observed in swainsonine-treated control cells during the recovery period after removal of swainsonine. These studies suggest the presence of a second lysosomal alpha-mannosidase activity which is unaffected in genetic alpha-mannosidosis, but is inhibited by swainsonine. This enzyme would cleave the alpha(1----6)-linked mannose residue from branched Man3GlcNAc to form Man alpha 1----3Man beta 1----4GlcNAc. To confirm this hypothesis, fractions from alpha-mannosidosis and control fibroblasts that bound to concanavalin A (ConA)-Sepharose and were eluted with 0.5 M alpha-methyl mannoside were incubated at pH 4.0 with Man alpha 1----6[Man alpha 1----3]Man beta 1----4-GlcNAc. As anticipated, Man alpha 1----3Man beta 1----4GlcNAc was the sole product using enzyme from mannosidosis fibroblasts, while the major product from control fibroblasts was Man alpha 1----6Man beta 1----4GlcNAc. This confirmed the presence of a swainsonine-inhibitable alpha(1----6)-mannosidase activity unaffected by the disease. The differing substrate specificities of the alpha(1----6)-mannosidase and the major lysosomal alpha-mannosidase indicate that the alpha(1----6)-mannosidase plays an important role in the generation of the oligosaccharides accumulated in alpha-mannosidosis patients."

Most of the apps and devices are customized with limited options, and they are usually non-generic or publicly unavailable. In this paper, we present WaDa, an easy to use app for sensor data collection from commercial off-the-shelf Android smart watches. It provides handy features such as user-defined labels, time synchronization, sensor selection, and data navigation. WaDa, freely available for research and academic purposes, facilitates prompt data collection without requiring expertise and effort for custom device/app development."

I discuss how the problems and prospects that concerned me 30 years ago are still relevant today. In particular, I elaborate on the intellectual frustrations faced by formal sociologists, the need for new mathematics to capture social science insights, the diversity of inquiry and lack of unification in mathematical sociology, and the need for formalists to offer empirically grounded models that appeal to the general reader on the basis of the empirical puzzles they explain."
10,f509b2603d279e2a8bdefae8d5faf764ee45a212,"Economic, social and political inequality between different identity groups is an important contributor to violent conflicts within societies. To deepen our understanding of the underlying social dynamics, we develop a mathematical model describing cooperation and conflict in a society composed of multiple factions engaged in economic and political interactions. Our model predicts that growing economic and political inequality tends to lead to the collapse of cooperation between factions that were initially seeking to cooperate. Certain mechanisms can delay this process, including the decoupling of political and economic power through rule of law and allegiance to the state or dominant faction. Counterintuitively, anti-conformity (a social norm for independent action) can also stabilize society, by preventing initial defections from cooperation from cascading through society. However, the availability of certain material resources that can be acquired by the state without cooperation with other factions has the opposite effect. We test several of these predictions using a multivariate statistical analysis of data covering 75 countries worldwide. Using social unrest as a proxy for the breakdown of cooperation in society, we find support for many of the predictions from our theory."

Sentence type correlates strongly with intonation patterns in most languages; we hypothesize that these intonation patterns are a valuable signal to a language learner, indicating different syntactic patterns. To test this hypothesis, we train a Bayesian Hidden Markov Model (and variants) on child-directed speech. We first show that simply training a separate model for each sentence type decreases performance due to sparse data. As an alternative, we propose two new models based on the BHMM in which sentence type is an observed variable which influences either emission or transition probabilities. Both models outperform a standard BHMM on data from English, Cantonese, and Dutch. This suggests that sentence type information available from intonational cues may be helpful for syntactic acquisition cross-linguistically."

We consider groups of a broad variety, motivated by ideas from the social sciences on groups and their roles in social identity. By modeling group affiliations, we allow the possibility of efficient higher-level relational reasoning about the groups themselves, where the number of groups is relatively small compared to the number of users. We discuss preliminary results from experiments using real social media data collected from Twitter."

In our work, we try to predict killer and victim pairs using data on previous kills as well as additionalmetadata. We construct a network where two character nodes are linked if one killed the other, then use a link prediction framework to evaluate different techniques for kill predictions. Lastly, we compute various network properties on a social network of characters anduse them as features in conjunction with classic data mining techniques. Due to the small size of the dataset and the somewhatrandom kill distribution, we cannot make accurate predictions with standard indices alone, although using them in conjunction with additional rules based on degrees has yielded results that are more reliable. The features we compute on the social network help theclassic machine learning approaches; however, they do not yield very accurate predictions. The best results overall are achieved using indices that use simple degree information, the best of which result in the Area Under the ROC Curve of 0.875."

This bound appears to imply that some problems may be unlearnable since ΠH(m) is so large. However, as we discussed in the last lecture, there are cases where ΠH(m) is not exponential. In particular, Sauer’s Lemma shows that if the VC Dimension of H is finite, then ΠH(m) will be polynomial in m. Let us recall the definition of VC Dimension and Sauer’s Lemma."

24,1f6ec1380ebedb32d165be456afcdc518d4e581d,"—Graph Representation Learning (GRL) has become a key paradigm in network analysis, with a plethora of interdis-ciplinary applications. As the scale of networks increases, most of the widely used learning-based graph representation models also face computational challenges. While there is a recent effort toward designing algorithms that solely deal with scalability issues, most of them behave poorly in terms of accuracy on downstream tasks. In this paper, we aim to study models that balance the trade-off between efﬁciency and accuracy. In particu- lar, we propose N ODE S IG , a scalable model that computes binary node representations. N ODE S IG exploits random walk diffusion probabilities via stable random projections towards efﬁciently computing embeddings in the Hamming space. Our extensive experimental evaluation on various networks has demonstrated that the proposed model achieves a good balance between accuracy and efﬁciency compared to well-known baseline models on the node classiﬁcation and link prediction tasks."

27,5bacedbae9d99a755abbc6b4eb2f849e99311d8d,"We present the nearest subclass classifier (NSC), which is a classification algorithm that unifies the flexibility of the nearest neighbor classifier with the robustness of the nearest mean classifier. The algorithm is based on the maximum variance cluster algorithm and, as such, it belongs to the class of prototype-based classifiers. The variance constraint parameter of the cluster algorithm serves to regularize the classifier, that is, to prevent overfitting. With a low variance constraint value, the classifier turns into the nearest neighbor classifier and, with a high variance parameter, it becomes the nearest mean classifier with the respective properties. In other words, the number of prototypes ranges from the whole training set to only one per class. In the experiments, we compared the NSC with regard to its performance and data set compression ratio to several other prototype-based methods. On several data sets, the NSC performed similarly to the k-nearest neighbor classifier, which is a well-established classifier in many domains. Also concerning storage requirements and classification speed, the NSC has favorable properties, so it gives a good compromise between classification performance and efficiency."

Although most research has focused on the way that computer-mediated communication is changing transnational collective action, it is unclear how social movement reliance on this new form of communication is modifying protest within nation-states. This paper analyses how participants in a national day of action in the United States were mobilized, focusing on the role that the Internet played. We find that a very high percentage of participants in all cities heard about the day of action through e-mail lists or websites. Those who mobilized through the Internet, however, were very different from those who mobilized through personal and organizational ties. In particular, the participants who heard about the event through all channels of mediated communication – including the Internet – were much more likely to come to the event alone than those who heard about it through their social networks. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of our findings to collective action and civic participation in the digital age."

In this paper we present King, a tool that accurately and quickly estimates the latency between arbitrary end hosts by using recursive DNS queries in a novel way. Compared to previous approaches, King has several advantages. Unlike IDMaps, King does not require the deployment of additional infrastructure, and unlike GNP, King does not require end hosts to agree upon a set of reference points. Unlike both IDMaps and GNP, King's estimates are based on direct online measurements rather than offline extrapolation. Because King uses existing DNS infrastructure, King scales naturally both in terms of the number of hosts that can be measured and in terms of the number of hosts performing measurements.After describing the techniques used in King, we present an extensive evaluation and analysis of the accuracy and consistency of our tool. Specifically, our evaluation shows that the accuracy of King is significantly better than the accuracy of IDMaps, and that King tends to preserve order among its latency estimates. Finally, we describe a variety of measurement studies and applications that could benefit from our tool, and present results from one such measurement study."

The application of participatory approaches for improving basin-scale water governance should be considered in light of critical analysis of community-based natural resources management and institutional design principles for common-property resources management. Problems of conflicting interests and contextual contingency (politics and history) illustrate the need for revising assumptions and expectations. A community perspective on principles for institutional design leads to distinct priorities for improving basin water allocation. Measures to support community involvement in basin water governance – such as legislative reform, legal empowerment, networking, advocacy, participatory planning, technical advice and facilitation – should be formulated to fit community priorities for negotiating rights to water."

Prior literature has showed that it is possible to accurately match profiles, but their evaluation focused only on sampled datasets. In this paper, we study the extent to which we can reliably match profiles in practice, across real-world social networks, by exploiting public attributes, i.e., information users publicly provide about themselves. Today's social networks have hundreds of millions of users, which brings completely new challenges as a reliable matching scheme must identify the correct matching profile out of the millions of possible profiles. We first define a set of properties for profile attributes--Availability, Consistency, non-Impersonability, and Discriminability (ACID)--that are both necessary and sufficient to determine the reliability of a matching scheme. Using these properties, we propose a method to evaluate the accuracy of matching schemes in real practical cases. Our results show that the accuracy in practice is significantly lower than the one reported in prior literature. When considering entire social networks, there is a non-negligible number of profiles that belong to different users but have similar attributes, which leads to many false matches. Our paper sheds light on the limits of matching profiles in the real world and illustrates the correct methodology to evaluate matching schemes in realistic scenarios."
37,3fb5dabc734f8511cb5c78ecc2d1d4a3327de7ba,"Recent studies have shown that the stricter content moderation policies imposed by mainstream social networking sites (SNSs) stimulated the growth of low-moderated but relatively open discussion platforms such as Telegram. Despite Telegram’s growing popularity among (deplatformed) digital exiles, and high potential for news dissemination, information consumption, mobilization, and radicalization, little is known about information flows with respect to politically and socially relevant topics within the Telegramsphere. We scrutinize the Telegramsphere as an information-sharing ecosystem of current affairs by uncovering how information flows indicated by content-overlap and shared users influenced the structure of Telegram networks and shaped communities over time. Using state-of-the-art web-mining, neural topic modeling, and social network analysis techniques on a unique data set that spans the full messaging history (N = 2,033,661) of 174 Dutch-language public Telegram chats/channels, we show that over time, conspiracy-themed, far-right activist, and COVID-19-sceptical communities dominated the Dutch Telegramsphere of current affairs. Our findings raise concerns with respect to Telegram’s polarization and radicalization capacity in the context of consuming socially and politically relevant information online. [ FROM AUTHOR]"
38,569d4a6b90b0abf72a7ebd6c117b48ea42c7e754,"We study the strength of the genetic barrier to neutral gene flow in a general one‐locus, two‐allele model that includes viability selection as well as fertility selection and premating isolation. We have separately considered adult migration and pollen migration. Our theoretical results suggest that selection against hybrid formation in the form of fertility selection or assortative mating is more effective in preventing introgression of neutral alleles than is reduction in hybrid viability. We argue that in experimental studies of introgression testing of F1 hybrids is as important as testing of parental forms. To illustrate the utility of this approach, we estimate the strength of the barrier to neutral gene flow between Piriqueta caroliniana and P. viridis, between Iris hexagona and I. fulva, and between Chorthippus brunneus and C. biguttulus."

In a heavily digitized society, security vulnerabilities pose a significant threat that is publicly discussed on social media. This study presents a comparison of user-generated content related to security vulnerabilities on three digital platforms: two social media conversation channels (Reddit and Twitter) and a collaborative software development platform (GitHub). Our data analysis shows that while more security vulnerabilities are discussed on Twitter, relevant conversations go viral earlier on Reddit. We show that the two social media platforms can be used to accurately predict activity on GitHub. CCS CONCEPTS • Networks → Online social networks; • Theory of computation → Social networks."

We examine how the frame of postdebate news analysis primes audience reflection on a previously viewed segment from the 2004 presidential debates (a process we identify as ‘‘primed reflection’’). Results show that the influence of postdebate news analysis is a function of the interaction between the news-analysis frame (policy vs. performance) and the individual-level factors, namely, political knowledge and propensity to reflect on media content."
